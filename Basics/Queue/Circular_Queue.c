// Simple Menu-Driven Circular Queue Program
// • Implements a circular queue using an array (fixed size) where the pointer uses formula:(pointer + 1) % Size_of_array to move.
// • Provides basic operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek (view front), and Display.
// • Uses a menu loop so the user can repeatedly choose operations.
// • Handles queue overflow and underflow efficiently by wrapping around the array.
